                    An animal is considered extinct when the last remaining member of its species dies out and there is not a single individual left on Earth. Causes of extinction might include an epidemic, extreme climate changes, loss of food sources, and destruction of their natural habitats. When a large number of species goes out of existence in some major calamity, it is called an extinction event

                        Multiple wildlife conservation organizations keep track of different species and their population trends, taking measures to help them survive. The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), established in 1948, is one of the most authoritative among these.

                    <p>
                        They classify animals in various conservation statuses (depending on their number and population trends), including Least Concern, Threatened, Endangered, and lastly Extinct. This makes it easy for us to find out any animals Conservation Status.
